        <p>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calcolated using the formola: BMI =
            mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables</li>
            <li> Calculate both their BMIs</li>
            <li> Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.</li>
            <li>Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher
                than John's? true"). </li>
        </ol>
        <p> GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>

        <p>John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and
            103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.</p>
        <Ol>
            <li> Calculate the average score for each team</li>
            <li> Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also
                include the average score in the output.</li>
            <li> Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a
                draw (the same average score)</li>
            <li>EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the
                average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't
                solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)</li>
            <li> Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.

        <h2>* CODING CHALLENGE 3</h2>
        <p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
        </p>
        <p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). <br>He likes to tip
            20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200,<br> and 10% if
            the bill is more than $200.</p>
        <p>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
            <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)</p>

        <h2>*CODING CHALLENGE 4</h2>
        <p>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the
            same functionality with objects and methods.</p>
        <Ol>
            <li> For each of them, create an object with properties for their fOll name, mass, and height</li>
            <li>Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it
                from the method.</li>
            <li>In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective
                BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.</li>
        </Ol>
        <p>Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kO and height in meter).</p>
        <p> GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>

    <div class="challenge" id="challenge_5">
        <h2> * CODING CHALLENGE 5</h2>
        <p>Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!</p>
        <p>This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
            <br>
            John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200,
            and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:</p>
            <li> Create an object with an array for the bill values</li>
            <li>Add a method to calculate the tip</li>
            <li>This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations</li>
            <li>As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts
                (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.</li>
        </ol>

            <p>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills
                were $77, $375, $110, and $45. <br>
                Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and
                $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping roles</li>
            <li>Create a function (not a method) to calcolate the average of a given array of tips. HINT: Loop over the
                array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the
                sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calcolate the average)</li>
            <li>Calcolate the average tip for each family</li>
            <li>Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average</li>

        </ol>
        <p>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>
